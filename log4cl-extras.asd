  :description "A bunch of addons to LOG4CL: JSON appender, context fields, cross-finger appender, etc."
  :long-description "

This library extends LOG4CL system in a few ways:

* It helps with configuration of multiple appenders and layouts.
* Has a facility to catch context fields and to log them.
* Has a macro to log unhandled errors.
* Adds a layout to write messages as JSON, which is useful for production as makes easier to parse and process such logs.
* Uses the appenders which are not disabled in case of some error which again, should be useful for production.
